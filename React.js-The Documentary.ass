Dialogue: 0,0:26:35.76,0:26:50.03,Default,,0,0,0,,广告团队在我加入之前刚刚用Bolt重写了"广告创建流"模块，花了他们六个月用Bolt代替古老的PHP代码\Nthe ads team just before I joined ads from the mobile team had done a full rewrite of the ads creation flow into bolt which took them I think upwards of six months replacing a very old PHP application with what time was

Dialogue: 0,0:27:39.90,0:27:44.22,Default,,0,0,0,,React的优势显然在于它能很好地处理复杂性\Non the pro side of react obviously there's all the things that we know now it handles complexity way way more even
Dialogue: 0,0:27:44.22,0:27:52.62,Default,,0,0,0,,比如说在用Bolt重写"广告创建流"模块的时候，我们已经出现不得不写出意大利面条代码的情况\Nwhen writing the as creation flow in bold we had already hit one place that you just could not do in Bolt without writing spaghetti code and you can do in
Dialogue: 0,0:27:52.62,0:28:00.72,Default,,0,0,0,,但是使用React可以很好解决这个问题，我们认为尽管这种情况可能只会在十个项目中出现一次\Nreact so we knew in the future even if it was only 10 of the experiences we were building we're going to run into this problem again now it might only be

Dialogue: 0,0:28:05.96,0:28:12.53,Default,,0,0,0,, React的缺点是它还没有经过足够多的考验，很多东西当时React根本做不到\Nthe cons of it on the other hand were that react in a lot of ways was not battle tested yet there's a lot of things that simply
Dialogue: 0,0:28:12.53,0:28:16.44,Default,,0,0,0,,比如它不能很好处理表单，文本框\Ndidn't work in react it couldn't handle forms they'd never done a text box and
Dialogue: 0,0:28:16.44,0:28:25.42,Default,,0,0,0,,处理表单元素比如单选按钮时过于复杂，还有就是会不必要地重新渲染大块UI而导致性能问题\Nthere's a lot of complexities around handing awkward form controls like radio buttons and so on that it messed up just performance issues where it would try and re-render large blocks
Dialogue: 0,0:28:25.52,0:28:31.30,Default,,0,0,0,,也就是他们还没来得及做Raact框架的性能优化\Nso they hadn't had to do all of the performance improvements that obviously exist now

Dialogue: 0,1:05:38.94,1:05:43.93,Default,,0,0,0,,blocks or like a scrollable text with like\Ndifferent effects and stuff. And so creating
Dialogue: 0,1:05:43.93,1:05:50.03,Default,,0,0,0,,a dynamic kind of interactive editor for for\Nthese things was really difficult. And were
Dialogue: 0,1:05:50.03,1:05:53.70,Default,,0,0,0,,doing it with Backbone. I kind of wanted to\Ngive React a try because it was supposed to
Dialogue: 0,1:05:53.70,1:05:59.18,Default,,0,0,0,,solve this problem. The first React component\NI wrote was a like button so it was just like
Dialogue: 0,1:05:59.18,1:06:05.30,Default,,0,0,0,,a button you click it and it says like you\Nlike this or you and somebody like this or
Dialogue: 0,1:06:05.30,1:06:11.02,Default,,0,0,0,,you and like 40 others like this. So there\Nwas a bit of like a split and logic, and then
Dialogue: 0,1:06:11.02,1:06:18.90,Default,,0,0,0,,the way you would express this in other Frameworks\Nat the time, you had to kind of manually watch
Dialogue: 0,1:06:18.90,1:06:23.54,Default,,0,0,0,,what's changed and update it. And in React\Nyou could just say, if nobody liked this show
Dialogue: 0,1:06:23.54,1:06:28.35,Default,,0,0,0,,this, if one person like this, show this,\Notherwise show this and like it's a very natural
Dialogue: 0,1:06:28.35,1:06:33.63,Default,,0,0,0,,way to write this kind of code. And yeah I\Njust wrote that button and I was like yeah
Dialogue: 0,1:06:33.63,1:06:40.98,Default,,0,0,0,,that looks good, ship it. And so we actually\Nrewrote the entire app in React over the course
Dialogue: 0,1:06:40.98,1:06:46.47,Default,,0,0,0,,of like 9 months while still shipping new\Nfeatures. So React sped up our development

Dialogue: 0,1:07:31.75,1:07:36.76,Default,,0,0,0,,it earlier at React conf. A really clever\Nfellow called Dan Abramov figured this out
Dialogue: 0,1:07:36.76,1:07:42.04,Default,,0,0,0,,and he created the React Hot Loader. And I\Nfelt that well then that just wouldn't be
Dialogue: 0,1:07:42.04,1:07:46.21,Default,,0,0,0,,interesting because people kind of already\Nsaw it which in retrospect I don't think it
Dialogue: 0,1:07:46.21,1:07:50.35,Default,,0,0,0,,would be true but that's how I saw it at the\Ntime. So I wanted to kind of spice it up a
Dialogue: 0,1:07:50.35,1:07:55.96,Default,,0,0,0,,little bit and I wanted to make a proof of\Nconcept of a thing I saw in a Bret Victor
Dialogue: 0,1:07:55.96,1:08:02.20,Default,,0,0,0,,demo that is often referred to as time traveling.\NIf you're designing something embedded in
Dialogue: 0,1:08:02.20,1:08:06.63,Default,,0,0,0,,time, you need to be able to control time,\Nyou need to be able to see across time, otherwise
Dialogue: 0,1:08:06.63,1:08:11.39,Default,,0,0,0,,you're designing blind. I didn't really know\Nhow to do it but I thought that's a cool idea
Dialogue: 0,1:08:11.39,1:08:16.81,Default,,0,0,0,,for a talk. So I'm gonna send the proposal\Nif the proposal is successful then I'll just
Dialogue: 0,1:08:16.81,1:08:20.54,Default,,0,0,0,,figure it out. And it turned out that the\Nproposal was more successful than I thought
Dialogue: 0,1:08:20.54,1:08:25.60,Default,,0,0,0,,it would be and so I made a proof of concept\Nfor that and that proof of concept became
Dialogue: 0,1:08:25.60,1:08:26.92,Default,,0,0,0,,known as Redux.
Dialogue: 0,1:08:28.64,1:08:33.26,Default,,0,0,0,,So my talk is about developer\Ntools because React and Hot Loading and time
Dialogue: 0,1:08:33.27,1:08:39.96,Default,,0,0,0,,travel these are all developer tools. He was\Nliterally creating Redux in service of being
Dialogue: 0,1:08:39.96,1:08:44.85,Default,,0,0,0,,able to deliver this talk and I called it\Npresentation driven development because the
Dialogue: 0,1:08:44.85,1:08:49.54,Default,,0,0,0,,thing that shook out of it was you know this\Nsort of like canonical state management library
Dialogue: 0,1:08:49.54,1:08:54.75,Default,,0,0,0,,for React apps for several years. Most of\Nmy work is around the React ecosystem because
Dialogue: 0,1:08:54.75,1:08:59.77,Default,,0,0,0,,that's what inspired me to contribute to the\Nopen source in the first place, but there
Dialogue: 0,1:08:59.77,1:09:06.12,Default,,0,0,0,,are two particular projects that I'm going\Nto talk about today. It was very validating
Dialogue: 0,1:09:06.12,1:09:14.85,Default,,0,0,0,,to give that talk but I was not surprised\Nby the response because well I had my doubts
Dialogue: 0,1:09:14.85,1:09:21.72,Default,,0,0,0,,but also I thought the talk was good.. like\NI thought it's a really good talk. And I was
Dialogue: 0,1:09:21.72,1:09:27.25,Default,,0,0,0,,glad that people also liked it but I think\Nit was actually not the talk that was really
Dialogue: 0,1:09:27.25,1:09:30.08,Default,,0,0,0,,like the moment for me. I think it was just\Nlike being there.
Dialogue: 0,1:09:31.80,1:09:33.34,Default,,0,0,0,,It kind of felt like
Dialogue: 0,1:09:33.35,1:09:38.40,Default,,0,0,0,,going to Hogwarts for the first\Ntime. I think it kind of had this this feeling
Dialogue: 0,1:09:38.40,1:09:44.38,Default,,0,0,0,,because there were all these people who I\Nonly knew them as these avatars and when you
Dialogue: 0,1:09:44.39,1:09:48.87,Default,,0,0,0,,meet somebody in person they kind of become\Nthree-dimensional of course. You kind of see
Dialogue: 0,1:09:48.87,1:09:53.73,Default,,0,0,0,,the whole picture. And I think it was just\Nlike such a wholesome feeling. It's the feeling
Dialogue: 0,1:09:53.73,1:09:58.87,Default,,0,0,0,,that we are all trying to figure out what\Nwe can do with this thing and we don't know
Dialogue: 0,1:09:58.87,1:10:01.42,Default,,0,0,0,,it yet and we're just playing with it.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:05.92,1:10:11.85,Default,,0,0,0,,That's also where I met Jing Chen. I had asked\Nfor her advice before because she's one of
Dialogue: 0,1:10:11.85,1:10:17.40,Default,,0,0,0,,the co-creators of the Flux architecture.\NSo it was nice to meet her in person and she
Dialogue: 0,1:10:17.40,1:10:23.39,Default,,0,0,0,,mentioned that actually Facebook is hiring\Nin London. And so they arranged an interview
Dialogue: 0,1:10:23.39,1:10:27.42,Default,,0,0,0,,for me right at the conference which was like\Nour normal interview process the same I think
Dialogue: 0,1:10:27.42,1:10:31.98,Default,,0,0,0,,like four interviews or something like this\Nbut I missed the second day of the conference
Dialogue: 0,1:10:31.98,1:10:37.10,Default,,0,0,0,,but we just did an interview there and so\Nthat's kind of how I got into Facebook. We
Dialogue: 0,1:10:37.10,1:10:43.12,Default,,0,0,0,,just quickly grabbed them out of the conference\Na little bit like on the down low and then
Dialogue: 0,1:10:43.12,1:10:48.53,Default,,0,0,0,,conducted the interviews in the basement of\Na hotel I think.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:50.69,1:10:54.03,Default,,0,0,0,,No Dan is special, he's always been a little\Nspecial.
Dialogue: 0,1:10:54.03,1:10:55.58,Default,,0,0,0,,I guess like I would think of myself
Dialogue: 0,1:10:55.58,1:11:02.52,Default,,0,0,0,,as like maybe the first member of what would\Nbecome the React team as you know it today
Dialogue: 0,1:11:02.52,1:11:08.98,Default,,0,0,0,,because I joined a little bit earlier than\NI think Andrew, Brian, Luna and and like a
Dialogue: 0,1:11:08.98,1:11:14.21,Default,,0,0,0,,bunch of other people who work with us now.\NAnd I joined at the time when a few people
Dialogue: 0,1:11:14.21,1:11:19.96,Default,,0,0,0,,who worked with us before were just about\Nto leave. So I was kind of in this transitional
Dialogue: 0,1:11:19.96,1:11:22.64,Default,,0,0,0,,period when the team was changing a lot.

Dialogue: 0,1:11:40.05,1:11:43.73,Default,,0,0,0,,I met him yeah.. I thought it was at React\Nconf. Well that was the clear moment, maybe,
Dialogue: 0,1:11:43.73,1:11:49.18,Default,,0,0,0,,was that the first time? Did you get invited\Nto React conf because of that.. He had a speech.
Dialogue: 0,1:11:50.57,1:11:56.72,Default,,0,0,0,,I met him like I think before that. I met\Nyou and Sophie and Joe and Tim like all in
Dialogue: 0,1:11:56.72,1:12:01.58,Default,,0,0,0,,the same week. Yeah he started asking some\Nquestions that were very similar to the questions
Dialogue: 0,1:12:01.58,1:12:06.15,Default,,0,0,0,,that on the team we were talking about internally\Nand so I just remember like, I gotta connect
Dialogue: 0,1:12:06.15,1:12:09.58,Default,,0,0,0,,you with like Sebastian and Jordan and the\Nrest of the team. Yeah and then also I was
Dialogue: 0,1:12:09.58,1:12:13.81,Default,,0,0,0,,like to the recruiters I was like yeah this\Nguy like we gotta hire this Andrew guy. And
Dialogue: 0,1:12:13.81,1:12:17.54,Default,,0,0,0,,I think we were really fortunate early on\Nto have a bunch of people that kind of stepped
Dialogue: 0,1:12:17.54,1:12:22.06,Default,,0,0,0,,up and they were this seems cool, I just want\Nto be a part of this, I just want to help.
Dialogue: 0,1:12:22.06,1:12:26.46,Default,,0,0,0,,I didn't realize it was kind of like a freshman\Nclass sort of feeling at the time. Sophie
Dialogue: 0,1:12:26.46,1:12:31.28,Default,,0,0,0,,had started managing the team around that\Ntime as well and I couldn't have really asked
Dialogue: 0,1:12:31.28,1:12:38.73,Default,,0,0,0,,for a better both project and set of colleagues\Nand team to join. The beginning of phase two.

Dialogue: 0,1:13:08.25,1:13:12.55,Default,,0,0,0,,We tried to watch some of the numbers like the number of GitHub stars
Dialogue: 0,1:13:12.55,1:13:15.66,Default,,0,0,0,,or the number of npm downloads. On Google
Dialogue: 0,1:13:15.66,1:13:21.69,Default,,0,0,0,,Trends, how many people are searching for\NReact and none of those numbers are perfect
Dialogue: 0,1:13:21.69,1:13:29.34,Default,,0,0,0,,but basically all of them kept going up over\Ntime and eventually got to a point where we
Dialogue: 0,1:13:29.34,1:13:35.81,Default,,0,0,0,,looked at it and said oh yeah like millions\Nof people essentially are using React.
Dialogue: 0,1:13:35.81,1:13:43.09,Default,,0,0,0,,There are a lot of little details in how we did\Nthings that encourages an ecosystem to participate,
Dialogue: 0,1:13:43.09,1:13:49.06,Default,,0,0,0,,that were critical parts in making it what\Nit is today. We didn't put everything in the
Dialogue: 0,1:13:49.06,1:13:54.38,Default,,0,0,0,,framework. We left a lot of it to the ecosystem\Nto innovate. And we got a lot of contributions,
Dialogue: 0,1:13:54.38,1:14:01.23,Default,,0,0,0,,we got a lot of interest that way, we got\Na lot of things spurring from that. It was
Dialogue: 0,1:14:01.23,1:14:07.67,Default,,0,0,0,,not ever a foregone conclusion. Like it's\Nstill surreal to me that it's as popular as
Dialogue: 0,1:14:07.67,1:14:13.55,Default,,0,0,0,,it is. It's this great example of this like\Nunderdog technology within a big company where
Dialogue: 0,1:14:13.55,1:14:18.04,Default,,0,0,0,,there could have been these forces that really\Npushed back on it. I think a lot of elements
Dialogue: 0,1:14:18.04,1:14:24.31,Default,,0,0,0,,of good timing, good fortune, good luck, good\Nleadership support, all sort of like aggregated
Dialogue: 0,1:14:24.31,1:14:31.74,Default,,0,0,0,,to allow React to be a success, that had we\Nmissed a few of those or had a handful more
Dialogue: 0,1:14:31.74,1:14:36.55,Default,,0,0,0,,things failed instead of succeeded, then I\Ndo not think React would be in the spot that
Dialogue: 0,1:14:36.55,1:14:42.84,Default,,0,0,0,,it is today. I feel like you can't take anyone\Nout of it and have it be what it became. I
Dialogue: 0,1:14:42.84,1:14:46.55,Default,,0,0,0,,think in the early days obviously Jordan,\Nright. Like this thing wouldn't exist. And
Dialogue: 0,1:14:46.55,1:14:51.56,Default,,0,0,0,,then Jing Chen just absolutely critical. I\Nmean she was so instrumental in the early
Dialogue: 0,1:14:51.56,1:14:56.07,Default,,0,0,0,,days of React that it just wouldn't have been\Na thing that we cared about if it didn't prove
Dialogue: 0,1:14:56.07,1:15:03.44,Default,,0,0,0,,itself. And then Shane O'Sullivan is responsible\Nfor you know really I mean a very hard decision
Dialogue: 0,1:15:03.44,1:15:07.77,Default,,0,0,0,,to like I'm gonna go this path instead of\Nthat thing. And then the engineers that worked
Dialogue: 0,1:15:07.77,1:15:12.00,Default,,0,0,0,,on refining and iterating on it and turning\Nit into something good it was Chedeau and
Dialogue: 0,1:15:12.00,1:15:16.60,Default,,0,0,0,,Paul O'Shannessy and Pete Hunt. And my manager\NAdam Wolff, when I was like you know asking
Dialogue: 0,1:15:16.60,1:15:20.86,Default,,0,0,0,,all these questions about like should we be\Ndoing, like is this even worth it, especially

Dialogue: 0,1:15:24.78,1:15:29.52,Default,,0,0,0,,and be like: no look it is delivering value,\Nthis is good, keep going. And there's different
Dialogue: 0,1:15:29.52,1:15:34.15,Default,,0,0,0,,phases too right, you have the early, early\Ndays and you had the like for the next literally
Dialogue: 0,1:15:34.15,1:15:40.30,Default,,0,0,0,,almost we're going on 10 years now, with Sebastian's\Ntechnical leadership and Andrew and Dan and
