Dialogue: 0,0:24:52.08,0:24:53.88,Default,,0,0,0,,we had to take this thing that was very

Dialogue: 0,1:05:22.92,1:05:25.07,Default,,0,0,0,,second just for the record I did not
Dialogue: 0,1:05:25.07,1:05:27.35,Default,,0,0,0,,create react react was created by Jordan
Dialogue: 0,1:05:27.35,1:05:29.76,Default,,0,0,0,,walk
Dialogue: 0,1:05:29.76,1:05:32.70,Default,,0,0,0,,I worked at a small startup we were
Dialogue: 0,1:05:32.70,1:05:35.04,Default,,0,0,0,,creating a sort of a digital publishing
Dialogue: 0,1:05:35.04,1:05:37.14,Default,,0,0,0,,platform so there was a really complex
Dialogue: 0,1:05:37.14,1:05:40.31,Default,,0,0,0,,post editor with different blocks or
Dialogue: 0,1:05:40.31,1:05:42.00,Default,,0,0,0,,like a scrollable text with like
Dialogue: 0,1:05:42.00,1:05:44.40,Default,,0,0,0,,different effects and stuff and so uh
Dialogue: 0,1:05:44.40,1:05:46.26,Default,,0,0,0,,creating a dynamic kind of interactive
Dialogue: 0,1:05:46.26,1:05:49.02,Default,,0,0,0,,editor for for these things was really
Dialogue: 0,1:05:49.02,1:05:50.57,Default,,0,0,0,,difficult and we returned it with
Dialogue: 0,1:05:50.57,1:05:52.55,Default,,0,0,0,,backbone I kind of wanted to give react
Dialogue: 0,1:05:52.55,1:05:54.18,Default,,0,0,0,,a try because it was supposed to solve
Dialogue: 0,1:05:54.18,1:05:55.14,Default,,0,0,0,,this problem
Dialogue: 0,1:05:55.14,1:05:57.59,Default,,0,0,0,,the first react component I wrote was a
Dialogue: 0,1:05:57.59,1:05:59.88,Default,,0,0,0,,like button so it was just like a button
Dialogue: 0,1:05:59.88,1:06:01.50,Default,,0,0,0,,you click it and it says like you like
Dialogue: 0,1:06:01.50,1:06:05.64,Default,,0,0,0,,this or you and somebody like this or
Dialogue: 0,1:06:05.64,1:06:08.64,Default,,0,0,0,,you and like 40 others like this so
Dialogue: 0,1:06:08.64,1:06:10.02,Default,,0,0,0,,there was a bit of like a split and
Dialogue: 0,1:06:10.02,1:06:11.88,Default,,0,0,0,,logic and then the way you would Express
Dialogue: 0,1:06:11.88,1:06:15.05,Default,,0,0,0,,this in uh like in other Frameworks at
Dialogue: 0,1:06:15.05,1:06:17.22,Default,,0,0,0,,the time uh like you had you had to kind
Dialogue: 0,1:06:17.22,1:06:19.79,Default,,0,0,0,,of manually like watch what's changed
Dialogue: 0,1:06:19.79,1:06:21.66,Default,,0,0,0,,and like update it and in react you
Dialogue: 0,1:06:21.66,1:06:23.76,Default,,0,0,0,,could just say if nobody liked this show
Dialogue: 0,1:06:23.76,1:06:25.92,Default,,0,0,0,,this if one person like this show this
Dialogue: 0,1:06:25.92,1:06:28.02,Default,,0,0,0,,otherwise show this and like it's a very
Dialogue: 0,1:06:28.02,1:06:30.42,Default,,0,0,0,,natural way to write this kind of code
Dialogue: 0,1:06:30.42,1:06:32.88,Default,,0,0,0,,and yeah I just wrote that button and I
Dialogue: 0,1:06:32.88,1:06:35.33,Default,,0,0,0,,was like yeah that looks good ship it
Dialogue: 0,1:06:35.33,1:06:39.24,Default,,0,0,0,,and so we actually rewrote the entire
Dialogue: 0,1:06:39.24,1:06:41.81,Default,,0,0,0,,app in react over the course of like 90
Dialogue: 0,1:06:41.81,1:06:44.46,Default,,0,0,0,,months while still shipping new features
Dialogue: 0,1:06:44.46,1:06:46.92,Default,,0,0,0,,so react speed up our development so
Dialogue: 0,1:06:46.92,1:06:49.02,Default,,0,0,0,,much that we were able to add new
Dialogue: 0,1:06:49.02,1:06:50.88,Default,,0,0,0,,features faster at the same time as we
Dialogue: 0,1:06:50.88,1:06:52.92,Default,,0,0,0,,were replacing old features that's why I
Dialogue: 0,1:06:52.92,1:06:56.96,Default,,0,0,0,,really kind of fell in love with it
Dialogue: 0,1:06:58.02,1:06:59.88,Default,,0,0,0,,a lot of things didn't exist back then
Dialogue: 0,1:06:59.88,1:07:01.92,Default,,0,0,0,,like there was no such thing as a react
Dialogue: 0,1:07:01.92,1:07:04.92,Default,,0,0,0,,ecosystem so if you needed something
Dialogue: 0,1:07:04.92,1:07:07.98,Default,,0,0,0,,it didn't exist you'd have to write it
Dialogue: 0,1:07:07.98,1:07:09.35,Default,,0,0,0,,so like you'd have to figure out how to
Dialogue: 0,1:07:09.35,1:07:11.33,Default,,0,0,0,,do it because otherwise you're not going
Dialogue: 0,1:07:11.33,1:07:14.22,Default,,0,0,0,,to have a product right so that's kind
Dialogue: 0,1:07:14.22,1:07:16.38,Default,,0,0,0,,of what I did for a bunch of things
Dialogue: 0,1:07:16.38,1:07:19.02,Default,,0,0,0,,one of those projects in particular was
Dialogue: 0,1:07:19.02,1:07:20.28,Default,,0,0,0,,uh
Dialogue: 0,1:07:20.28,1:07:22.20,Default,,0,0,0,,like I just saw like a big opportunity
Dialogue: 0,1:07:22.20,1:07:24.11,Default,,0,0,0,,there
Dialogue: 0,1:07:24.11,1:07:26.46,Default,,0,0,0,,it was called react hot loader at the
Dialogue: 0,1:07:26.46,1:07:28.02,Default,,0,0,0,,time so I wanted to give a talk about
Dialogue: 0,1:07:28.02,1:07:28.92,Default,,0,0,0,,that
Dialogue: 0,1:07:28.92,1:07:31.55,Default,,0,0,0,,somebody else has done a talk that
Dialogue: 0,1:07:31.55,1:07:34.38,Default,,0,0,0,,mentioned it earlier at reactant a
Dialogue: 0,1:07:34.38,1:07:36.18,Default,,0,0,0,,really clever fellow called Damn abramov
Dialogue: 0,1:07:36.18,1:07:38.03,Default,,0,0,0,,figured this out and he created the
Dialogue: 0,1:07:38.03,1:07:40.38,Default,,0,0,0,,react hotloader and I felt that well
Dialogue: 0,1:07:40.38,1:07:42.66,Default,,0,0,0,,then that just wouldn't be interesting
Dialogue: 0,1:07:42.66,1:07:44.64,Default,,0,0,0,,because people kind of already saw it
Dialogue: 0,1:07:44.64,1:07:46.38,Default,,0,0,0,,which in retrospect I don't think it
Dialogue: 0,1:07:46.38,1:07:48.29,Default,,0,0,0,,would be true but that's how I saw it at
Dialogue: 0,1:07:48.29,1:07:50.28,Default,,0,0,0,,the time so I wanted to kind of spice it
Dialogue: 0,1:07:50.28,1:07:52.50,Default,,0,0,0,,up a little bit and I wanted to make a
Dialogue: 0,1:07:52.50,1:07:54.83,Default,,0,0,0,,proof of concept of a thing I saw in
Dialogue: 0,1:07:54.83,1:07:57.18,Default,,0,0,0,,breath Victor's demo that is often
Dialogue: 0,1:07:57.18,1:08:00.48,Default,,0,0,0,,referred to as time traveling
Dialogue: 0,1:08:00.48,1:08:02.16,Default,,0,0,0,,you're designing something embedded in
Dialogue: 0,1:08:02.16,1:08:03.96,Default,,0,0,0,,time you need to be able to control time
Dialogue: 0,1:08:03.96,1:08:06.00,Default,,0,0,0,,you need to be able to see across time
Dialogue: 0,1:08:06.00,1:08:08.52,Default,,0,0,0,,otherwise you're designing blind
Dialogue: 0,1:08:08.52,1:08:10.50,Default,,0,0,0,,I didn't really know how to do it but I
Dialogue: 0,1:08:10.50,1:08:12.35,Default,,0,0,0,,thought that's a cool idea for a talk so
Dialogue: 0,1:08:12.35,1:08:14.52,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm gonna send the proposal if the
Dialogue: 0,1:08:14.52,1:08:16.79,Default,,0,0,0,,proposal is successful then I'll just
Dialogue: 0,1:08:16.79,1:08:18.89,Default,,0,0,0,,figure it out and it turned out that the
Dialogue: 0,1:08:18.89,1:08:20.46,Default,,0,0,0,,proposal was more successful than I
Dialogue: 0,1:08:20.46,1:08:22.14,Default,,0,0,0,,thought it would be and so I made a
Dialogue: 0,1:08:22.14,1:08:23.93,Default,,0,0,0,,proof of concept for that and that
Dialogue: 0,1:08:23.93,1:08:28.56,Default,,0,0,0,,approval concept became known as Redux
Dialogue: 0,1:08:28.56,1:08:30.89,Default,,0,0,0,,so my talk is about developer tools
Dialogue: 0,1:08:30.89,1:08:33.29,Default,,0,0,0,,because react and hotel ordering and
Dialogue: 0,1:08:33.29,1:08:35.39,Default,,0,0,0,,time travel these are all developer
Dialogue: 0,1:08:35.39,1:08:37.43,Default,,0,0,0,,tools he was like literally creating
Dialogue: 0,1:08:37.43,1:08:40.67,Default,,0,0,0,,Redux in service of being able to
Dialogue: 0,1:08:40.67,1:08:42.60,Default,,0,0,0,,deliver this this talk and I called it
Dialogue: 0,1:08:42.60,1:08:44.81,Default,,0,0,0,,presentation driven development because
Dialogue: 0,1:08:44.81,1:08:47.21,Default,,0,0,0,,the Thing That Shook out of it was you
Dialogue: 0,1:08:47.21,1:08:48.77,Default,,0,0,0,,know this sort of like canonical State
Dialogue: 0,1:08:48.77,1:08:50.75,Default,,0,0,0,,Management library for react apps for
Dialogue: 0,1:08:50.75,1:08:53.10,Default,,0,0,0,,for several years most of my work is
Dialogue: 0,1:08:53.10,1:08:54.83,Default,,0,0,0,,around the react ecosystem because
Dialogue: 0,1:08:54.83,1:08:56.52,Default,,0,0,0,,that's what inspired me to contribute to
Dialogue: 0,1:08:56.52,1:08:59.69,Default,,0,0,0,,the open source in the first place but
Dialogue: 0,1:08:59.69,1:09:01.62,Default,,0,0,0,,there are two particular projects that
Dialogue: 0,1:09:01.62,1:09:03.77,Default,,0,0,0,,I'm going to talk about today it was
Dialogue: 0,1:09:03.77,1:09:05.00,Default,,0,0,0,,very
Dialogue: 0,1:09:05.00,1:09:07.81,Default,,0,0,0,,validating to give that talk
Dialogue: 0,1:09:07.81,1:09:11.27,Default,,0,0,0,,but I was not surprised by
Dialogue: 0,1:09:11.27,1:09:14.21,Default,,0,0,0,,the response because well I I had my
Dialogue: 0,1:09:14.21,1:09:16.56,Default,,0,0,0,,doubts but also I thought the talk was
Dialogue: 0,1:09:16.56,1:09:18.83,Default,,0,0,0,,good like I thought it's a really good
Dialogue: 0,1:09:18.83,1:09:19.56,Default,,0,0,0,,talk
Dialogue: 0,1:09:19.56,1:09:23.33,Default,,0,0,0,,and I was glad that people also liked it
Dialogue: 0,1:09:23.33,1:09:25.25,Default,,0,0,0,,but I think it was actually not the talk
Dialogue: 0,1:09:25.25,1:09:27.66,Default,,0,0,0,,that was uh that was really like the
Dialogue: 0,1:09:27.66,1:09:29.46,Default,,0,0,0,,moment for me I think it was just like
Dialogue: 0,1:09:29.46,1:09:31.85,Default,,0,0,0,,being there
Dialogue: 0,1:09:31.85,1:09:34.02,Default,,0,0,0,,I kind of felt like you know like like

Dialogue: 0,1:09:39.96,1:09:42.06,Default,,0,0,0,,people who I only knew them as these
Dialogue: 0,1:09:42.06,1:09:44.81,Default,,0,0,0,,avatars and when I season meet somebody
Dialogue: 0,1:09:44.81,1:09:46.73,Default,,0,0,0,,in person they they kind of become

Dialogue: 0,1:09:48.83,1:09:51.00,Default,,0,0,0,,see the whole picture and I think it was
Dialogue: 0,1:09:51.00,1:09:53.39,Default,,0,0,0,,just like such a wholesome feeling is
Dialogue: 0,1:09:53.39,1:09:56.10,Default,,0,0,0,,the feeling that we are all trying to
Dialogue: 0,1:09:56.10,1:09:58.02,Default,,0,0,0,,figure out what we can do with this
