Dialogue: 0,0:26:35.76,0:26:50.03,Default,,0,0,0,,广告团队在我加入之前刚刚用Bolt重写了"广告创建流"模块，花了他们六个月用Bolt代替古老的PHP代码\Nthe ads team just before I joined ads from the mobile team had done a full rewrite of the ads creation flow into bolt which took them I think upwards of six months replacing a very old PHP application with what time was

Dialogue: 0,0:27:39.90,0:27:44.22,Default,,0,0,0,,React的优势显然在于它能很好地处理复杂性\Non the pro side of react obviously there's all the things that we know now it handles complexity way way more even
Dialogue: 0,0:27:44.22,0:27:52.62,Default,,0,0,0,,比如说在用Bolt重写"广告创建流"模块的时候，我们已经出现不得不写出意大利面条代码的情况\Nwhen writing the as creation flow in bold we had already hit one place that you just could not do in Bolt without writing spaghetti code and you can do in

Dialogue: 0,0:28:05.96,0:28:12.53,Default,,0,0,0,, React的缺点是它还没有经过足够多的考验，很多东西当时React根本做不到\Nthe cons of it on the other hand were that react in a lot of ways was not battle tested yet there's a lot of things that simply
Dialogue: 0,0:28:12.53,0:28:16.44,Default,,0,0,0,,比如它不能很好处理表单，文本框\Ndidn't work in react it couldn't handle forms they'd never done a text box and

Dialogue: 0,0:44:49.07,0:44:53.22,Default,,0,0,0,,it was a brand new project that had just been open sourced and not many people
Dialogue: 0,0:44:53.22,0:44:57.72,Default,,0,0,0,,had used it before and so there were a bunch of rough edges it seemed like you
Dialogue: 0,0:44:57.72,0:45:01.68,Default,,0,0,0,,know maybe nobody had tried to use it in a particular way before or if something
Dialogue: 0,0:45:01.68,0:45:05.09,Default,,0,0,0,,just wasn't documented well enough and I was trying to use it a slightly
Dialogue: 0,0:45:05.09,0:45:10.28,Default,,0,0,0,,different way than it was intended I ran into these little bugs or issues where
Dialogue: 0,0:45:10.28,0:45:18.00,Default,,0,0,0,,it didn't work quite as I was expecting it to for some of those I read through the source code and tried to figure out
Dialogue: 0,0:45:18.00,0:45:21.02,Default,,0,0,0,,okay why isn't this working is there anything that I can be doing differently
Dialogue: 0,0:45:21.02,0:45:29.76,Default,,0,0,0,,for other cases I ended up joining the IRC chat Channel where a lot of the core
Dialogue: 0,0:45:29.76,0:45:34.50,Default,,0,0,0,,team members were hanging out after it had been open sourced
Dialogue: 0,0:45:34.50,0:45:40.07,Default,,0,0,0,,that helped me get started not just using react but also starting to
Dialogue: 0,0:45:40.07,0:45:44.28,Default,,0,0,0,,contribute to it as I started filing issues and helping other people who were
Dialogue: 0,0:45:44.28,0:45:50.57,Default,,0,0,0,,in that chat room as well as starting to make small code changes and starting to
Dialogue: 0,0:45:50.57,0:45:55.68,Default,,0,0,0,,improve react over time her perspective from you know Khan Academy and just
Dialogue: 0,0:45:55.68,0:46:00.90,Default,,0,0,0,,being outside of Facebook was so valuable so helpful so if he started as
Dialogue: 0,0:46:00.90,0:46:05.16,Default,,0,0,0,,someone using react externally then sort of like moved on to being
Dialogue: 0,0:46:05.16,0:46:09.54,Default,,0,0,0,,someone who contributed to react core externally then became the most
Dialogue: 0,0:46:09.54,0:46:14.33,Default,,0,0,0,,significant contributor to react core then we would have these like weekly
Dialogue: 0,0:46:14.33,0:46:18.78,Default,,0,0,0,,team meetings and invite Sophie to come and so Sophie like worked out with her
Dialogue: 0,0:46:18.78,0:46:23.16,Default,,0,0,0,,local manager at her company to like carve out Friday afternoons to come to
Dialogue: 0,0:46:23.16,0:46:28.85,Default,,0,0,0,,Facebook and hang out with us and so determined not to do what we had done
Dialogue: 0,0:46:28.85,0:46:33.78,Default,,0,0,0,,previously where we hired folks from the open source community and then they
Dialogue: 0,0:46:33.78,0:46:43.64,Default,,0,0,0,,never contributed anything back she became like the the first ever like open source recruited member of the team

Dialogue: 0,0:46:46.31,0:46:51.72,Default,,0,0,0,,of the react team it also got them thinking that maybe just maybe the rest
Dialogue: 0,0:46:51.72,0:46:57.66,Default,,0,0,0,,of the ecosystem had just misreact unfairly they had something special they
Dialogue: 0,0:46:57.66,0:47:02.57,Default,,0,0,0,,knew it what they didn't know was how to convince everyone else
Dialogue: 0,0:47:02.57,0:47:06.24,Default,,0,0,0,,I think there are people on the team like me and Jordan and Tom and
Dialogue: 0,0:47:06.24,0:47:13.31,Default,,0,0,0,,christadeau who like the The Challenge and the the competitive nature of it we
Dialogue: 0,0:47:13.31,0:47:20.22,Default,,0,0,0,,knew that this was good technology and I was so sure of that that um
Dialogue: 0,0:47:20.22,0:47:25.31,Default,,0,0,0,,you know I viewed it as just a a messaging problem you know okay we gotta
Dialogue: 0,0:47:25.31,0:47:28.14,Default,,0,0,0,,crack how we message this to people because they don't get it and we have to
Dialogue: 0,0:47:28.14,0:47:31.07,Default,,0,0,0,,figure out how to how to bring them there
Dialogue: 0,0:47:31.07,0:47:35.64,Default,,0,0,0,,the open source feels like a milestone and it feels like this is the end my
Dialogue: 0,0:47:35.64,0:47:39.54,Default,,0,0,0,,impressive is just the beginning because when you open social actually have zero
Dialogue: 0,0:47:39.54,0:47:43.92,Default,,0,0,0,,users now you need to actually like build a community uh get all of the bug
Dialogue: 0,0:47:43.92,0:47:47.81,Default,,0,0,0,,fixed like make sure it actually solves the use case for the people and so this
Dialogue: 0,0:47:47.81,0:47:53.94,Default,,0,0,0,,is like when the Journey Begins we buckle down we and we we also realized I
Dialogue: 0,0:47:53.94,0:47:58.02,Default,,0,0,0,,think that really when you have a project like this that's
Dialogue: 0,0:47:58.02,0:48:01.61,Default,,0,0,0,,um different you have to convince people one by one
Dialogue: 0,0:48:01.61,0:48:06.42,Default,,0,0,0,,so I think that's really what we focused on and we learned a lot doing that we
Dialogue: 0,0:48:06.42,0:48:10.38,Default,,0,0,0,,learned that the ideas in reactor are solid but
Dialogue: 0,0:48:10.38,0:48:14.04,Default,,0,0,0,,really the ideas are not what people encounter when they adopt a framework
Dialogue: 0,0:48:14.04,0:48:19.44,Default,,0,0,0,,what they encounter are the docs and the error messages what they need more than
Dialogue: 0,0:48:19.44,0:48:23.88,Default,,0,0,0,,anything else when they adopt something is an incremental way of doing that
Dialogue: 0,0:48:23.88,0:48:28.20,Default,,0,0,0,,so the team got to work they focused on spreading the knowledge of react one
Dialogue: 0,0:48:28.20,0:48:33.83,Default,,0,0,0,,concept at a time one person at a time then an opportunity arose
Dialogue: 0,0:48:33.83,0:48:39.35,Default,,0,0,0,,another conference later the same year thank goodness Pete
Dialogue: 0,0:48:39.35,0:48:46.02,Default,,0,0,0,,gave a talk at jsconf EU I had my desk over by the um by the product infrastructure team I was sitting next
Dialogue: 0,0:48:46.02,0:48:52.14,Default,,0,0,0,,to Tomo and he's like oh we're just like sponsoring this JS conf EU conference
Dialogue: 0,0:48:52.14,0:48:56.40,Default,,0,0,0,,and like we have to give a keynote and like I don't want to give it because I
Dialogue: 0,0:48:56.40,0:49:00.83,Default,,0,0,0,,think he was like he didn't want to go through all that stuff because you know after you give the talk like people go
Dialogue: 0,0:49:00.83,0:49:04.50,Default,,0,0,0,,and yell at you after you get off stage and you go to the happy hour and stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:49:04.50,0:49:08.64,Default,,0,0,0,,it's like it's not not the most Pleasant thing in the world and I was like I'll
Dialogue: 0,0:49:08.64,0:49:11.70,Default,,0,0,0,,do it um I'll take the free trip to Berlin and
Dialogue: 0,0:49:11.70,0:49:16.44,Default,,0,0,0,,go uh give a talk at a conference hey I'm Pete uh I'm gonna talk to you about
Dialogue: 0,0:49:16.44,0:49:20.46,Default,,0,0,0,,a library for creating user interfaces that we call react
Dialogue: 0,0:49:20.46,0:49:26.57,Default,,0,0,0,,and we open source this at jsconfus a couple months ago and we got some kind
Dialogue: 0,0:49:26.57,0:49:30.18,Default,,0,0,0,,of sarcastic responses on Twitter a little bit of snickering that kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:49:30.18,0:49:33.54,Default,,0,0,0,,thing um we weren't really communicating what
Dialogue: 0,0:49:33.54,0:49:35.81,Default,,0,0,0,,we were doing um so I'd like to talk to you today
Dialogue: 0,0:49:35.81,0:49:39.66,Default,,0,0,0,,about the design decisions um around react uh what we're doing
Dialogue: 0,0:49:39.66,0:49:43.50,Default,,0,0,0,,differently than other Frameworks and kind of the implementation that lets us
Dialogue: 0,0:49:43.50,0:49:47.81,Default,,0,0,0,,make these decisions and make it really fast for this talk it was like here's what
Dialogue: 0,0:49:47.81,0:49:51.48,Default,,0,0,0,,makes react different I'm not even trying to say it's good I'm not even
Dialogue: 0,0:49:51.48,0:49:54.42,Default,,0,0,0,,trying to say you should use it I'm trying to say that this is interesting
Dialogue: 0,0:49:54.42,0:49:58.92,Default,,0,0,0,,and there's a lot of interesting stuff about how this thing works that you
Dialogue: 0,0:49:58.92,0:50:01.92,Default,,0,0,0,,should pay attention to and
Dialogue: 0,0:50:01.92,0:50:06.00,Default,,0,0,0,,um that really resonated with people and so we got these kind of early innovators
Dialogue: 0,0:50:06.00,0:50:08.70,Default,,0,0,0,,you know if you think of the crossing the chasm
Dialogue: 0,0:50:08.70,0:50:12.72,Default,,0,0,0,,diagram where you've got your your early adopters and then you've got your
Dialogue: 0,0:50:12.72,0:50:16.74,Default,,0,0,0,,laggers and in the middle you have your kind of normal companies that talk
Dialogue: 0,0:50:16.74,0:50:20.64,Default,,0,0,0,,really got those early adopters fired up and evangelized and react inside of
Dialogue: 0,0:50:20.64,0:50:24.35,Default,,0,0,0,,their own companies after Pete's talk interest started to pick up people
Dialogue: 0,0:50:24.35,0:50:28.20,Default,,0,0,0,,started paying attention they just wanted to you know let me let me just
Dialogue: 0,0:50:28.20,0:50:32.70,Default,,0,0,0,,see if there's something there and so we got this kind of like Slow Burn of
Dialogue: 0,0:50:32.70,0:50:36.11,Default,,0,0,0,,adoption of react and it prompted some really interesting conversations it
Dialogue: 0,0:50:36.11,0:50:39.72,Default,,0,0,0,,recruited Brandon Bloom into the community who came from the functional
Dialogue: 0,0:50:39.72,0:50:43.61,Default,,0,0,0,,programming World somewhere he started
Dialogue: 0,0:50:43.61,0:50:45.96,Default,,0,0,0,,talking to his friends and said hey I
Dialogue: 0,0:50:45.96,0:50:48.78,Default,,0,0,0,,think this like react thing is actually worth paying attention to and then he
Dialogue: 0,0:50:48.78,0:50:53.57,Default,,0,0,0,,goes and talks to his friend David Nolan who is this very well known very well
Dialogue: 0,0:50:53.57,0:50:58.74,Default,,0,0,0,,respected really great musician and JavaScript developer I think he was
Dialogue: 0,0:50:58.74,0:51:03.59,Default,,0,0,0,,working at the New York Times at the time and I was passing through New York
Dialogue: 0,0:51:03.59,0:51:10.26,Default,,0,0,0,,to do something and it grabbed coffee and I asked Pete some questions and
Dialogue: 0,0:51:10.26,0:51:14.09,Default,,0,0,0,,Brandon Brandon Bloom that was my friend that said you should really look at
Dialogue: 0,0:51:14.09,0:51:19.55,Default,,0,0,0,,react and the reason I was excited about it more than I think you could have been
Dialogue: 0,0:51:19.55,0:51:23.33,Default,,0,0,0,,if you were JavaScript developer JavaScript is kind of multi-paradigm you
Dialogue: 0,0:51:23.33,0:51:26.70,Default,,0,0,0,,can do object oriented you can do functional if you want but it's not
Dialogue: 0,0:51:26.70,0:51:32.33,Default,,0,0,0,,required but in closure enclosure script functional is the most idiomatic thing
Dialogue: 0,0:51:32.33,0:51:37.14,Default,,0,0,0,,and nothing existed like we were sort of like always trying to get things to work
Dialogue: 0,0:51:37.14,0:51:40.68,Default,,0,0,0,,but it was always felt like there was friction I was like
Dialogue: 0,0:51:40.68,0:51:44.94,Default,,0,0,0,,still early in my career right and this is like really senior super smart
Dialogue: 0,0:51:44.94,0:51:48.72,Default,,0,0,0,,engineer and it was the type of thing where like he would ask me questions
Dialogue: 0,0:51:48.72,0:51:53.22,Default,,0,0,0,,about it and I would like stumble to explain it and I would explain it poorly
Dialogue: 0,0:51:53.22,0:51:59.09,Default,,0,0,0,,and then he would repeat it back to me in like a super eloquent great way and I
Dialogue: 0,0:51:59.09,0:52:03.96,Default,,0,0,0,,was like yes I'm gonna steal that and so when I sat with Brandon and Pete it was
Dialogue: 0,0:52:03.96,0:52:09.42,Default,,0,0,0,,like this huge light bulb went off I was like finally this is so Random uh
Dialogue: 0,0:52:09.42,0:52:14.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Facebook made this functional UI framework Eureka I mean it was
Dialogue: 0,0:52:14.88,0:52:19.74,Default,,0,0,0,,definitely a Eureka moment it it did allow closure script programmers to
Dialogue: 0,0:52:19.74,0:52:25.38,Default,,0,0,0,,finally write a reasonably performant functional uis and it was very natural
Dialogue: 0,0:52:25.38,0:52:29.52,Default,,0,0,0,,it was a very very good fit like a week or two later he wrote this blog post
Dialogue: 0,0:52:29.52,0:52:33.54,Default,,0,0,0,,called the future of JavaScript mvcs that just like changed the trajectory of
Dialogue: 0,0:52:33.54,0:52:37.07,Default,,0,0,0,,the project in many ways you look at react and
Dialogue: 0,0:52:37.07,0:52:40.55,Default,,0,0,0,,you're like there's no way this could be fast there's no way it could be
Dialogue: 0,0:52:40.55,0:52:45.54,Default,,0,0,0,,efficient and then I showed like you know these diagrams of what um backbone
Dialogue: 0,0:52:45.54,0:52:50.81,Default,,0,0,0,,and react ohm look like and react is much better especially when you're using
Dialogue: 0,0:52:50.81,0:52:56.52,Default,,0,0,0,,persistent data structures so my article I think was focusing purely on the
Dialogue: 0,0:52:56.52,0:53:01.61,Default,,0,0,0,,technical benefits of the design it removed The Superficial consideration
Dialogue: 0,0:53:01.61,0:53:08.16,Default,,0,0,0,,and I think people started saying okay I will try it not I'm going to use it but
Dialogue: 0,0:53:08.16,0:53:13.80,Default,,0,0,0,,it removed that I'm never going to use that too oh I'll give it a shot this is
Dialogue: 0,0:53:13.80,0:53:19.07,Default,,0,0,0,,interesting once that post came out like within three months after that I would
Dialogue: 0,0:53:19.07,0:53:22.02,Default,,0,0,0,,say that we were one of the big contenders if you were picking a
Dialogue: 0,0:53:22.02,0:53:25.31,Default,,0,0,0,,JavaScript framework if you want to spread an idea you need to really
Dialogue: 0,0:53:25.31,0:53:29.76,Default,,0,0,0,,convince a few people and have those people share your message
Dialogue: 0,0:53:29.76,0:53:34.02,Default,,0,0,0,,you can't just be shouting at yourself more people started to realize that
Dialogue: 0,0:53:34.02,0:53:40.38,Default,,0,0,0,,react some good ideas and made UI development
Dialogue: 0,0:53:40.38,0:53:45.92,Default,,0,0,0,,simpler in a lot of ways over the course of the next I would say like year or two
Dialogue: 0,0:53:45.92,0:53:51.72,Default,,0,0,0,,we're kind of just tracking things like you know like Google Alerts of how many
Dialogue: 0,0:53:51.72,0:53:55.20,Default,,0,0,0,,times is it being mentioned who's writing about it what projects are
Dialogue: 0,0:53:55.20,0:53:58.31,Default,,0,0,0,,cropping up um because react was very unopinionated
Dialogue: 0,0:53:58.31,0:54:04.92,Default,,0,0,0,,about a lot of stuff that you need in order to build a front-end web application and you know people would
Dialogue: 0,0:54:04.92,0:54:08.64,Default,,0,0,0,,fill in the blanks and there was a bunch of State Management libraries that
Dialogue: 0,0:54:08.64,0:54:12.30,Default,,0,0,0,,cropped up and there was a bunch of you know router libraries that cropped up
Dialogue: 0,0:54:12.30,0:54:16.80,Default,,0,0,0,,and server-side rendering strategies and so there was this sort of Slow Burn of
Dialogue: 0,0:54:16.80,0:54:22.26,Default,,0,0,0,,adoption over the next year or two react is a small focused UI library but it
Dialogue: 0,0:54:22.26,0:54:26.70,Default,,0,0,0,,proved capable when tackling Facebook's hardest problems in other big companies
Dialogue: 0,0:54:26.70,0:54:34.76,Default,,0,0,0,,noticed but there was one company especially eager to rethink best practices
Dialogue: 0,0:54:34.96,0:54:43.39,Default,,0,0,0,,[Music]
Dialogue: 0,0:54:46.04,0:54:50.88,Default,,0,0,0,,we first heard about react back in 2014 the Netflix website had been built using
Dialogue: 0,0:54:50.88,0:54:56.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Java web uh it was very slow it took about 15 minutes to get up a build and
Dialogue: 0,0:54:56.33,0:55:02.09,Default,,0,0,0,,we decided to move to a more modern framework there we go now at the time we
Dialogue: 0,0:55:02.09,0:55:04.92,Default,,0,0,0,,weren't quite sure if you know this react thing was going to work out it was
Dialogue: 0,0:55:04.92,0:55:09.11,Default,,0,0,0,,kind of new and so we were very apprehensive especially since we were
Dialogue: 0,0:55:09.11,0:55:13.02,Default,,0,0,0,,building the future of the next 10 years of the website right you know we make a
Dialogue: 0,0:55:13.02,0:55:17.16,Default,,0,0,0,,bad choice now we got to backtrack um you know years worth of work and so
Dialogue: 0,0:55:17.16,0:55:20.28,Default,,0,0,0,,we were very careful about you're not jumping into something that was too
Dialogue: 0,0:55:20.28,0:55:23.16,Default,,0,0,0,,bleeding edge and so what they did was they actually
Dialogue: 0,0:55:23.16,0:55:27.05,Default,,0,0,0,,pitted two teams against each other each was given 30 days to build a prototype
Dialogue: 0,0:55:27.05,0:55:31.07,Default,,0,0,0,,with one being react and the other one being backbone and after 30 days the
Dialogue: 0,0:55:31.07,0:55:36.54,Default,,0,0,0,,choice was clear so thank you all for coming out tonight
Dialogue: 0,0:55:36.54,0:55:39.11,Default,,0,0,0,,we're really excited to have you here and share the learnings that we've had
Dialogue: 0,0:55:39.11,0:55:43.68,Default,,0,0,0,,building the new UI in react for the past year it was not this stage it was our next
Dialogue: 0,0:55:43.68,0:55:49.02,Default,,0,0,0,,stage over where I gave my react presentation back I guess in 2015.
Dialogue: 0,0:55:49.02,0:55:53.33,Default,,0,0,0,,same feeling like oh my goodness I've got to convince all these people that
Dialogue: 0,0:55:53.33,0:55:58.55,Default,,0,0,0,,react is amazing um but I guess it worked so as part of
Dialogue: 0,0:55:58.55,0:56:03.30,Default,,0,0,0,,the team that built the new site using react at first it was very clunky like
Dialogue: 0,0:56:03.30,0:56:06.05,Default,,0,0,0,,you're writing components and they're not quite you know you're putting too
Dialogue: 0,0:56:06.05,0:56:10.92,Default,,0,0,0,,much logic into them or you're thinking too big it's not clear the difference in
Dialogue: 0,0:56:10.92,0:56:14.28,Default,,0,0,0,,the Paradigm and then you start to use it and you go okay wait wait wait I'm
Dialogue: 0,0:56:14.28,0:56:18.83,Default,,0,0,0,,thinking much more Atomic hence the symbol of react I'm thinking about this

Dialogue: 0,0:56:57.96,0:57:01.55,Default,,0,0,0,,faster as well so choosing react and going with a more modern framework
Dialogue: 0,0:57:01.55,0:57:05.57,Default,,0,0,0,,really helped us accelerate how fast we could build the website how fast we

Dialogue: 0,0:57:23.94,0:57:28.61,Default,,0,0,0,,we were there first because of react and its ability to move so quickly in terms of design
Dialogue: 0,0:57:28.61,0:57:36.68,Default,,0,0,0,,this is how it ended up turning out and this is a UI that's big and immersive and completely built in react so we're very very proud of it and the result

Dialogue: 0,1:00:54.35,1:00:57.83,Default,,0,0,0,,like a bunch of our projects like so react native and we started talking
Dialogue: 0,1:00:57.83,1:01:02.81,Default,,0,0,0,,about graphql about three day and so yeah it's been a massive success there
Dialogue: 0,1:01:02.81,1:01:12.42,Default,,0,0,0,,is this moment where you go and you see the stage and it's like there's a giant wood cut out like logo of the react atom and

Dialogue: 0,1:01:20.28,1:01:22.68,Default,,0,0,0,,thing because we needed a logo and I was like Michael just like throw something
Dialogue: 0,1:01:22.68,1:01:27.00,Default,,0,0,0,,together real quick and like now it's this thing that has somebody has built a
Dialogue: 0,1:01:27.00,1:01:30.78,Default,,0,0,0,,giant sign with this on it and there's something about the physical impact of
Dialogue: 0,1:01:30.78,1:01:34.98,Default,,0,0,0,,that that's really cool that was the moment when it dawned on me that react
Dialogue: 0,1:01:34.98,1:01:39.29,Default,,0,0,0,,was becoming something different you know so for a long time what react
Dialogue: 0,1:01:39.29,1:01:44.28,Default,,0,0,0,,was to me was a software project and the reason why I wanted people to
Dialogue: 0,1:01:44.28,1:01:47.40,Default,,0,0,0,,adopt it was because I really thought it would make their software better and
Dialogue: 0,1:01:47.40,1:01:51.59,Default,,0,0,0,,make their lives better and make their on-call rotations better there are a lot
Dialogue: 0,1:01:51.59,1:01:56.33,Default,,0,0,0,,of reasons why I thought it would help them after that conference what I realized is
Dialogue: 0,1:01:56.33,1:02:00.35,Default,,0,0,0,,that react was becoming a community there was meetups that would happen the
Dialogue: 0,1:02:00.35,1:02:03.66,Default,,0,0,0,,immediate next week that would have an expanded audience that they could go
Dialogue: 0,1:02:03.66,1:02:07.85,Default,,0,0,0,,deeper into some of the things that were discussed was really really cool and a
Dialogue: 0,1:02:07.85,1:02:12.18,Default,,0,0,0,,huge recognition for us that the community was going to be
Dialogue: 0,1:02:12.18,1:02:16.68,Default,,0,0,0,,an incredible part of what would make react work and had at that point was
Dialogue: 0,1:02:16.68,1:02:21.13,Default,,0,0,0,,definitely already a really important part of what had gotten react to that point so far

Dialogue: 0,1:02:23.81,1:02:28.31,Default,,0,0,0,,it's proven to me that uh engaging with your open source Community is is
Dialogue: 0,1:02:28.31,1:02:31.85,Default,,0,0,0,,actually more important than the technical work itself like if you don't
Dialogue: 0,1:02:31.85,1:02:35.33,Default,,0,0,0,,have a community you don't have an open source project I'm excited that we just
Dialogue: 0,1:02:35.33,1:02:38.81,Default,,0,0,0,,continue rethinking best practices I want to thank this community for making
Dialogue: 0,1:02:38.81,1:02:42.66,Default,,0,0,0,,it possible for us to keep investing in this and keep working on it
Dialogue: 0,1:02:42.66,1:02:50.33,Default,,0,0,0,,um that's all I got thanks it was a real high point for not just
Dialogue: 0,1:02:50.33,1:02:54.59,Default,,0,0,0,,for me but for the team and you know I think for Facebook engineering I think
Dialogue: 0,1:02:54.59,1:03:00.05,Default,,0,0,0,,we really felt like not just validated but like we were
Dialogue: 0,1:03:00.05,1:03:03.72,Default,,0,0,0,,actually like doing something that people cared about
Dialogue: 0,1:03:03.72,1:03:07.98,Default,,0,0,0,,and it was a really really good feeling it was already like more widely used
Dialogue: 0,1:03:07.98,1:03:12.24,Default,,0,0,0,,within the company but now it was like okay how do we like actually start
Dialogue: 0,1:03:12.24,1:03:16.02,Default,,0,0,0,,converting everything to react how do we like remove and deprecate like all of
Dialogue: 0,1:03:16.02,1:03:20.94,Default,,0,0,0,,the other Frameworks and really like double down on react oh hey I was going
Dialogue: 0,1:03:20.94,1:03:25.92,Default,,0,0,0,,going from like an interesting product to like this is the next big thing so it
Dialogue: 0,1:03:25.92,1:03:30.18,Default,,0,0,0,,was really like a really amazing time to be around and to like really like get
Dialogue: 0,1:03:30.18,1:03:36.07,Default,,0,0,0,,the whole company like working together as one uh you know to like make this happen
Dialogue: 0,1:03:36.68,1:03:47.52,Default,,0,0,0,,let's see I have some keepsakes up here which will be not easy for me to get down but
Dialogue: 0,1:03:47.96,1:03:57.00,Default,,0,0,0,,let's see I have some stickers oh this is a fun one this is the first ever react die cut sticker
Dialogue: 0,1:03:57.00,1:04:00.90,Default,,0,0,0,,we ordered like a bunch of these and put them on our laptops and I just I never
Dialogue: 0,1:04:00.90,1:04:06.05,Default,,0,0,0,,wanted to use the last one that I had Facebook open source stickers
Dialogue: 0,1:04:06.05,1:04:11.09,Default,,0,0,0,,oh some of these will be a trip down memory lane for folks react conf we made
Dialogue: 0,1:04:11.09,1:04:15.18,Default,,0,0,0,,you know 2018 Facebook open source
Dialogue: 0,1:04:15.18,1:04:22.16,Default,,0,0,0,,it's a good one react conf attendee badge this was a book uh from the original
Dialogue: 0,1:04:22.16,1:04:28.07,Default,,0,0,0,,react.js conf at Facebook's headquarters so this had a list of the speakers and
Dialogue: 0,1:04:28.07,1:04:35.94,Default,,0,0,0,,the schedule and um here's the Keynote and Christopher shadow
Dialogue: 0,1:04:35.94,1:04:42.18,Default,,0,0,0,,we had all sorts of swag made and a bunch of other stuff so pretty good stuff
Dialogue: 0,1:04:42.18,1:04:54.50,Default,,0,0,0,,pretty good memories dated with questions from the community and a new developer enters reacts orbit
Dialogue: 0,1:04:55.75,1:05:09.06,Default,,0,0,0,,[Music]
Dialogue: 0,1:05:12.14,1:05:19.44,Default,,0,0,0,,what should I do with my hands so you're saying that I should actually
Dialogue: 0,1:05:19.44,1:05:25.07,Default,,0,0,0,,uh start like uh let me Focus for a second just for the record I did not
Dialogue: 0,1:05:25.07,1:05:29.76,Default,,0,0,0,,create react react was created by Jordan walk
Dialogue: 0,1:05:29.76,1:05:35.04,Default,,0,0,0,,I worked at a small startup we were creating a sort of a digital publishing
Dialogue: 0,1:05:35.04,1:05:40.31,Default,,0,0,0,,platform so there was a really complex post editor with different blocks or
Dialogue: 0,1:05:40.31,1:05:44.40,Default,,0,0,0,,like a scrollable text with like different effects and stuff and so uh
Dialogue: 0,1:05:44.40,1:05:49.02,Default,,0,0,0,,creating a dynamic kind of interactive editor for for these things was really
Dialogue: 0,1:05:49.02,1:05:52.55,Default,,0,0,0,,difficult and we returned it with backbone I kind of wanted to give react
Dialogue: 0,1:05:52.55,1:05:57.59,Default,,0,0,0,,a try because it was supposed to solve this problem the first react component I wrote was a
Dialogue: 0,1:05:57.59,1:06:01.50,Default,,0,0,0,,like button so it was just like a button you click it and it says like you like
Dialogue: 0,1:06:01.50,1:06:08.64,Default,,0,0,0,,this or you and somebody like this or you and like 40 others like this so
Dialogue: 0,1:06:08.64,1:06:11.88,Default,,0,0,0,,there was a bit of like a split and logic and then the way you would Express
Dialogue: 0,1:06:11.88,1:06:17.22,Default,,0,0,0,,this in uh like in other Frameworks at the time uh like you had you had to kind
Dialogue: 0,1:06:17.22,1:06:21.66,Default,,0,0,0,,of manually like watch what's changed and like update it and in react you
Dialogue: 0,1:06:21.66,1:06:25.92,Default,,0,0,0,,could just say if nobody liked this show this if one person like this show this
Dialogue: 0,1:06:25.92,1:06:30.42,Default,,0,0,0,,otherwise show this and like it's a very natural way to write this kind of code
Dialogue: 0,1:06:30.42,1:06:35.33,Default,,0,0,0,,and yeah I just wrote that button and I was like yeah that looks good ship it
Dialogue: 0,1:06:35.33,1:06:41.81,Default,,0,0,0,,and so we actually rewrote the entire app in react over the course of like 90
Dialogue: 0,1:06:41.81,1:06:46.92,Default,,0,0,0,,months while still shipping new features so react speed up our development so
Dialogue: 0,1:06:46.92,1:06:50.88,Default,,0,0,0,,much that we were able to add new features faster at the same time as we
Dialogue: 0,1:06:50.88,1:06:56.96,Default,,0,0,0,,were replacing old features that's why I really kind of fell in love with it
Dialogue: 0,1:06:58.02,1:07:01.92,Default,,0,0,0,,a lot of things didn't exist back then like there was no such thing as a react
Dialogue: 0,1:07:01.92,1:07:07.98,Default,,0,0,0,,ecosystem so if you needed something it didn't exist you'd have to write it
Dialogue: 0,1:07:07.98,1:07:11.33,Default,,0,0,0,,so like you'd have to figure out how to do it because otherwise you're not going
Dialogue: 0,1:07:11.33,1:07:16.38,Default,,0,0,0,,to have a product right so that's kind of what I did for a bunch of things
Dialogue: 0,1:07:16.38,1:07:19.02,Default,,0,0,0,,one of those projects in particular was
Dialogue: 0,1:07:19.02,1:07:20.28,Default,,0,0,0,,uh
Dialogue: 0,1:07:20.28,1:07:26.46,Default,,0,0,0,,like I just saw like a big opportunity there it was called react hot loader at the
Dialogue: 0,1:07:26.46,1:07:31.55,Default,,0,0,0,,time so I wanted to give a talk about that somebody else has done a talk that
Dialogue: 0,1:07:31.55,1:07:36.18,Default,,0,0,0,,mentioned it earlier at reactant a really clever fellow called Damn abramov
Dialogue: 0,1:07:36.18,1:07:40.38,Default,,0,0,0,,figured this out and he created the react hotloader and I felt that well
Dialogue: 0,1:07:40.38,1:07:44.64,Default,,0,0,0,,then that just wouldn't be interesting because people kind of already saw it
Dialogue: 0,1:07:44.64,1:07:48.29,Default,,0,0,0,,which in retrospect I don't think it would be true but that's how I saw it at
Dialogue: 0,1:07:48.29,1:07:52.50,Default,,0,0,0,,the time so I wanted to kind of spice it up a little bit and I wanted to make a
Dialogue: 0,1:07:52.50,1:07:57.18,Default,,0,0,0,,proof of concept of a thing I saw in breath Victor's demo that is often
Dialogue: 0,1:07:57.18,1:08:02.16,Default,,0,0,0,,referred to as time traveling you're designing something embedded in
Dialogue: 0,1:08:02.16,1:08:06.00,Default,,0,0,0,,time you need to be able to control time you need to be able to see across time
Dialogue: 0,1:08:06.00,1:08:10.50,Default,,0,0,0,,otherwise you're designing blind I didn't really know how to do it but I
Dialogue: 0,1:08:10.50,1:08:14.52,Default,,0,0,0,,thought that's a cool idea for a talk so I'm gonna send the proposal if the
Dialogue: 0,1:08:14.52,1:08:18.89,Default,,0,0,0,,proposal is successful then I'll just figure it out and it turned out that the
Dialogue: 0,1:08:18.89,1:08:22.14,Default,,0,0,0,,proposal was more successful than I thought it would be and so I made a
Dialogue: 0,1:08:22.14,1:08:28.56,Default,,0,0,0,,proof of concept for that and that approval concept became known as Redux
Dialogue: 0,1:08:28.56,1:08:33.29,Default,,0,0,0,,so my talk is about developer tools because react and hotel ordering and
Dialogue: 0,1:08:33.29,1:08:37.43,Default,,0,0,0,,time travel these are all developer tools he was like literally creating
Dialogue: 0,1:08:37.43,1:08:42.60,Default,,0,0,0,,Redux in service of being able to deliver this this talk and I called it
Dialogue: 0,1:08:42.60,1:08:47.21,Default,,0,0,0,,presentation driven development because the Thing That Shook out of it was you
Dialogue: 0,1:08:47.21,1:08:50.75,Default,,0,0,0,,know this sort of like canonical State Management library for react apps for
Dialogue: 0,1:08:50.75,1:08:54.83,Default,,0,0,0,,for several years most of my work is around the react ecosystem because
Dialogue: 0,1:08:54.83,1:08:59.69,Default,,0,0,0,,that's what inspired me to contribute to the open source in the first place but
Dialogue: 0,1:08:59.69,1:09:03.77,Default,,0,0,0,,there are two particular projects that I'm going to talk about today it was
Dialogue: 0,1:09:03.77,1:09:07.81,Default,,0,0,0,,very validating to give that talk
Dialogue: 0,1:09:07.81,1:09:14.21,Default,,0,0,0,,but I was not surprised by the response because well I I had my
Dialogue: 0,1:09:14.21,1:09:19.56,Default,,0,0,0,,doubts but also I thought the talk was good like I thought it's a really good talk
Dialogue: 0,1:09:19.56,1:09:25.25,Default,,0,0,0,,and I was glad that people also liked it but I think it was actually not the talk
Dialogue: 0,1:09:25.25,1:09:29.46,Default,,0,0,0,,that was uh that was really like the moment for me I think it was just like
Dialogue: 0,1:09:29.46,1:09:34.02,Default,,0,0,0,,being there I kind of felt like you know like like
Dialogue: 0,1:09:34.02,1:09:38.33,Default,,0,0,0,,going to Hogwarts for the first time I think it kind of had this uh this
Dialogue: 0,1:09:38.33,1:09:42.06,Default,,0,0,0,,feeling because there were all these people who I only knew them as these
Dialogue: 0,1:09:42.06,1:09:46.73,Default,,0,0,0,,avatars and when I season meet somebody in person they they kind of become

Dialogue: 0,1:09:51.00,1:09:56.10,Default,,0,0,0,,just like such a wholesome feeling is the feeling that we are all trying to
Dialogue: 0,1:09:56.10,1:09:59.88,Default,,0,0,0,,figure out what we can do with this thing and we don't know it yet and we're
Dialogue: 0,1:09:59.88,1:10:09.17,Default,,0,0,0,,just playing with it that's also where I met jinchan I asked
Dialogue: 0,1:10:09.17,1:10:14.04,Default,,0,0,0,,for for her advice before because she's one of the co-creators of the fox
Dialogue: 0,1:10:14.04,1:10:18.12,Default,,0,0,0,,architecture so it was nice to meet her in person and she mentioned that

Dialogue: 0,1:10:27.42,1:10:31.56,Default,,0,0,0,,think like four interviews or something like this but I I missed the second day
Dialogue: 0,1:10:31.56,1:10:34.86,Default,,0,0,0,,of the conference but we just did an interview there and so that's kind of
Dialogue: 0,1:10:34.86,1:10:39.12,Default,,0,0,0,,how I got into Facebook we just quickly grabbed them out of the
Dialogue: 0,1:10:39.12,1:10:46.19,Default,,0,0,0,,conference a little bit like on the down low and then uh conducted the interviews
Dialogue: 0,1:10:46.19,1:10:51.90,Default,,0,0,0,,um in the basement of a hotel I think is that normal entries no Dan is so special
Dialogue: 0,1:10:51.90,1:10:56.04,Default,,0,0,0,,he's always been all special I guess like I would think of myself as like
Dialogue: 0,1:10:56.04,1:11:00.96,Default,,0,0,0,,maybe the first member of what would become the react
Dialogue: 0,1:11:00.96,1:11:05.88,Default,,0,0,0,,team as you know it today because I joined a little bit earlier than I think

Dialogue: 0,1:11:42.48,1:11:46.38,Default,,0,0,0,,clear moment maybe was that the first time we actually did you get invited to

Dialogue: 0,1:12:15.00,1:12:18.17,Default,,0,0,0,,early on to have a bunch of people liking that kind of stepped up and they
Dialogue: 0,1:12:18.17,1:12:21.78,Default,,0,0,0,,were like this seems cool I just want to be a part of this I just want to help
Dialogue: 0,1:12:21.78,1:12:25.26,Default,,0,0,0,,I didn't realize it was kind of like a freshman class sort of feeling at the
Dialogue: 0,1:12:25.26,1:12:29.34,Default,,0,0,0,,time started managing the team around that time as well
Dialogue: 0,1:12:29.34,1:12:34.56,Default,,0,0,0,,um and like I couldn't have really asked for a better uh both project and like a
Dialogue: 0,1:12:34.56,1:12:40.85,Default,,0,0,0,,set of colleagues and team to to join the beginning of phase two yeah that's cool

Dialogue: 0,1:12:58.56,1:13:03.06,Default,,0,0,0,,react was now out of the hands of its Founders it was ready to take on New
Dialogue: 0,1:13:03.06,1:13:08.88,Default,,0,0,0,,Life in the care of a new community grown and future-minded team we tried to
Dialogue: 0,1:13:08.88,1:13:13.19,Default,,0,0,0,,watch some of the numbers like the number of GitHub stars or the number of
Dialogue: 0,1:13:13.19,1:13:19.14,Default,,0,0,0,,npm downloads on Google Trends how many people are searching for react and none
Dialogue: 0,1:13:19.14,1:13:25.73,Default,,0,0,0,,of those numbers are perfect but basically all of them kept going up over
Dialogue: 0,1:13:25.73,1:13:31.80,Default,,0,0,0,,time and eventually got to a point where we looked at it and said oh yeah like
Dialogue: 0,1:13:31.80,1:13:37.44,Default,,0,0,0,,millions of people essentially are using react there are a lot of little details
Dialogue: 0,1:13:37.44,1:13:44.10,Default,,0,0,0,,in how we did things that encourages an ecosystem to participate that were
Dialogue: 0,1:13:44.10,1:13:48.42,Default,,0,0,0,,critical Parts on making it what it is today we didn't put everything in the
Dialogue: 0,1:13:48.42,1:13:54.00,Default,,0,0,0,,framework we left a lot of it to the ecosystem to innovate and we got a lot
Dialogue: 0,1:13:54.00,1:13:58.34,Default,,0,0,0,,of contributions we got a lot of interest that way we got a lot of things
Dialogue: 0,1:13:58.34,1:14:05.69,Default,,0,0,0,,spurring from that it was not ever a foregone conclusion I like it's still
Dialogue: 0,1:14:05.69,1:14:10.08,Default,,0,0,0,,surreal to me that it's as popular as it is it's this great example of this like
Dialogue: 0,1:14:10.08,1:14:15.23,Default,,0,0,0,,Underdog technology within a big company where there could have been these forces
Dialogue: 0,1:14:15.23,1:14:19.98,Default,,0,0,0,,that really pushed back on it I think a lot of elements of good timing Good
Dialogue: 0,1:14:19.98,1:14:24.71,Default,,0,0,0,,Fortune good luck good leadership support all sort of like aggregated to
Dialogue: 0,1:14:24.71,1:14:31.62,Default,,0,0,0,,allow react to be a success that had we missed a few of those or had a handful
Dialogue: 0,1:14:31.62,1:14:36.12,Default,,0,0,0,,more things failed instead of succeeded then I do not think react would be in
Dialogue: 0,1:14:36.12,1:14:40.02,Default,,0,0,0,,the spot that it is today I feel like you can't take anyone out of
Dialogue: 0,1:14:40.02,1:14:45.00,Default,,0,0,0,,it and have it be what it became I think in the early days obviously Jordan right
Dialogue: 0,1:14:45.00,1:14:49.56,Default,,0,0,0,,like this thing wouldn't exist and then Jing Chan just absolutely critical I
Dialogue: 0,1:14:49.56,1:14:52.86,Default,,0,0,0,,mean she was so instrumental in the early days of react that it just
Dialogue: 0,1:14:52.86,1:14:56.94,Default,,0,0,0,,wouldn't have been a thing that we cared about if it didn't prove itself
Dialogue: 0,1:14:56.94,1:15:02.46,Default,,0,0,0,,and then Shane O'Sullivan is responsible for you know really I mean a very hard
Dialogue: 0,1:15:02.46,1:15:07.19,Default,,0,0,0,,decision to like I'm gonna go this path instead of that thing and then the
Dialogue: 0,1:15:07.19,1:15:10.56,Default,,0,0,0,,engineers that worked on refining and iterating on it and turning it into
Dialogue: 0,1:15:10.56,1:15:14.82,Default,,0,0,0,,something good it was Chateau and Paul shantacy and Pete hunt and my manager
Dialogue: 0,1:15:14.82,1:15:18.06,Default,,0,0,0,,Adam wolf when I was like you know asking all these questions about like
Dialogue: 0,1:15:18.06,1:15:22.50,Default,,0,0,0,,should we be do like is this even worth it especially after JS conf when we were
Dialogue: 0,1:15:22.50,1:15:25.80,Default,,0,0,0,,feeling defeated you know he was there to pick me back up and be like no look
Dialogue: 0,1:15:25.80,1:15:30.30,Default,,0,0,0,,it is delivering value this is good keep going and there's different phases too
Dialogue: 0,1:15:30.30,1:15:34.32,Default,,0,0,0,,right you have the early early days and you had the like for the next literally
Dialogue: 0,1:15:34.32,1:15:38.76,Default,,0,0,0,,almost we're going on 10 years now with Sebastian's technical leadership and
Dialogue: 0,1:15:38.76,1:15:45.42,Default,,0,0,0,,Andrew and Dan and Dominic and flarney and Sophie and I I just feel like it's
Dialogue: 0,1:15:45.42,1:15:50.58,Default,,0,0,0,,just a group of incredible people and if you take any of them out of it
Dialogue: 0,1:15:50.58,1:15:55.08,Default,,0,0,0,,it just looks pretty different it was really a team effort
